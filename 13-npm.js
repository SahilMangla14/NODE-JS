// npm is node package manager
// When we install node, it also gets installed
// It enables us to do three things
// 1) reuse our own code in other projects
// 2) use code written by other developers
// 3) share our code with other developers
// NPM Project is hosted at npmjs.com

// What is a package?
// A package is essentially a folder that contains a JavaScript code
// There is not much difference between package, module and dependencies

// There is no quality control in NPM registry
// Anyone can publish anything
